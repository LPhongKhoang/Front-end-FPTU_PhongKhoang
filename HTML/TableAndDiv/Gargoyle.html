                        <p> This month Middle Age Arts introduces the Gargole Collection. I'm really excited about this new
                            set of classical figures.<br/>

                            The collection contains faithful reproductions of gargoyles from Europe, including Notre Dame, Rheims and Warwick Castle.
                            All reproductions are done to exacting and loving detail.<br/>

                            The collection also contains original works by noted artists such as Susan Bedford and Antonio Salvari. Our expert artissans have produced some
                            wonderful and shimsical works, perfectly suited for home or garden use.<br/>

                            Don't delay, order your gargoyle today.
